            <div class="section-content">
                <p>A swap is a derivative contract where two parties agree to exchange a series of future cash flows at specified times according to predetermined terms. Interest rate swaps, a common type, involve the exchange of interest rate payments.</p>
                <p>A swap can be thought of as a portfolio of forward contracts. For example, a three-year swap with semi-annual payments is conceptually equivalent to a series of six forward contracts, each with a different maturity but all using the same fixed price (the swap rate).</p>

                    <li>The fixed rate, known as the swap rate, remains constant throughout the life of the swap</li>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i> Pricing and Valuation Principles</h3>
                <p><strong>Pricing a swap</strong> involves determining the fixed rate of the swap at the contract's initiation date. This swap rate is set at a level that makes the present value (PV) of the expected fixed-rate payments equal to the present value (PV) of the expected floating-rate payments. This equalization ensures the swap's initial value is zero.</p>
                <p><strong>Valuing a swap</strong> is the process of determining its market value at any point after initiation. As interest rates fluctuate, the PVs of the fixed and floating legs will diverge, giving the swap a positive or negative value.</p>
                <p>An important operational aspect is that the floating rate is reset at the beginning of each settlement period based on the current market reference rate (MRR).</p>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-calculator"></i> Periodic Settlement Calculation</h3>
                <p>At the end of each period, a net cash flow is exchanged. The settlement amount from the perspective of the fixed-rate payer is calculated as follows:</p>
                <div class="formula">
                    Periodic Settlement = (MRR – Swap Rate) × Notional Amount × Period
                </div>
                <p><strong>Where:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>MRR</strong>: The Market Reference Rate (the floating rate) for that period</li>
                    <li><strong>Swap Rate (s<sub>N</sub>)</strong>: The fixed rate agreed upon in the contract</li>
                    <li><strong>Notional Amount</strong>: The principal amount upon which interest is calculated</li>
                    <li><strong>Period</strong>: The fraction of a year corresponding to the settlement period (e.g., 0.5 for semi-annual, 0.25 for quarterly)</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="example">
                    <h4><i class="fas fa-chart-bar"></i> Numerical Example</h4>
                    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Consider an interest rate swap with a notional amount of $20 million and quarterly payments (Period = 0.25). The fixed-rate payer agrees to a swap rate of 4%. At the beginning of a new quarter, the 3-month MRR is reset to 5%.</p>
                    
                    <div class="formula">
                        (0.05 – 0.04) × $20,000,000 × 0.25 = 0.01 × $20,000,000 × 0.25 = $50,000
                    </div>
                    
                    <p><strong>Result:</strong> Since the floating rate (5%) is higher than the fixed rate (4%), the fixed-rate payer will <em>receive</em> a net payment of $50,000 for this period.</p>
                </div>

                <h3><i class="fas fa-coins"></i> Replicating a Swap with Bonds</h3>
                <p>A powerful way to understand and value a swap is to view it as a combination of a fixed-rate bond and a floating-rate note (FRN). The position of a <strong>fixed-rate payer</strong> (who is also a floating-rate receiver) is economically equivalent to holding the following two positions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>A long position in a floating-rate note (FRN)</strong>: This provides the cash inflows from the floating rate (MRR)</li>
                    <li><strong>A short position in a fixed-rate bond</strong>: This creates the cash outflows of the fixed coupon, which is set equal to the swap rate</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Therefore, the value of the swap to the fixed-rate payer at any point in time is simply the value of the FRN minus the value of the fixed-rate bond.</p>
